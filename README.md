📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of a Linear Regression model for predicting housing prices. It walks through the following stages:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training using scikit-learn

Performance evaluation using regression metrics

The notebook offers a practical introduction to supervised regression tasks with real-world data.

🏠 Dataset
This project uses Transformed_Housing_Prices2.csv dataset

⚙️ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:


Copy https://github.com/not-adi/housing_price_prediction_linear-regression-model.git
paste on terminal
🧩 Installation
Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Or manually install the key libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
📓 Usage
Launch Jupyter Notebook and run through the notebook step-by-step:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook implement_linear_regression.ipynb
Alternatively, open with JupyterLab:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter lab implement_linear_regression.ipynb
📈 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using common regression metrics:

R² Score - 0.84

These help assess the accuracy of price predictions.

📊 Results

Metric	Value 
R² Score	0.84
Replace these with the actual values from your run.

🚀 Future Work
Add Ridge and Lasso Regression for regularization

Implement K-Fold Cross-Validation

Explore advanced models like Decision Trees or XGBoost

Develop a deployment pipeline (Flask/Streamlit API)

Build a simple frontend for user interaction
